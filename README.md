# ðŸ“Š Superstore Sales Analysis - PCA & Power BI  

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes **sales performance** in a superstore dataset using **Python for data analysis** and **Power BI for interactive visualizations**. The goal is to identify trends in **profitability, sales distribution, and discount effects** across product categories.  

Key techniques used:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction**
- **Power BI dashboard for business insights**  

ðŸ”— **Dataset Source:** [Superstore Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings  
- **Technology** is the highest revenue-generating category, with **Phones** and **Copiers** contributing significantly to profitability.  
- **Discounting strategies impact categories differently**â€”while some products benefit, others see diminished margins.  
- **PCA reveals underlying sales structures**, helping to segment and optimize product performance.  

These insights can inform **business strategy, pricing models, and inventory management** decisions.
